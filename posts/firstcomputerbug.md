We've all been there. After painstakingly transcribing a program from the deepest abysses of our brain, we hit run and <span style="font-weight: bold">BAM!</span> We get a bug.

Bugs are annoying at best and soul crushing at worst. But have you ever thought about the origin of terminology bug?

### The Origin of the word *Bug* 
Way back when, computers were the size of small houses. A computer by the title of Mark II at Harvard University was, by assumption, performing operations incorrectly (NA, Log Book With Computer Bug).

Upon further investigation a moth was found in the circuitry. This bug was taped into a book and was recorded as the first ever bug.
