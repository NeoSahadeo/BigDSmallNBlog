# Introduction
Ever wonder how we create these beautiful posts? Me neither! Nevertheless, here is a blog on how to create a post.
<br>
This site uses MarkDown files to display articles. Nothing fancy.

# Steps 

## Step 1
Clone the git repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/NeoSahadeo/BigDSmallNBlog
```

## Step 2
Create a new markdown file in the posts/ folder (your operating system should stop you from creating a duplicated file).

## Step 3
Copy the text from the template.md and paste that into the newly created file.

## Step 4
Update all the values in between the triple dashes.

## Step 5
WRITE THE BLOG!

## Step 6
Add the changes and push to the git repo.

# Conclusion
By now, you should be a full fledged MarkDown developer. If not... well that's OK. Hopefully you can now create posts on this site (assuming you can actually push to the repo).
