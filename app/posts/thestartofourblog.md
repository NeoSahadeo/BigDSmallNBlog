## Welcome to the blog
This is the first ever post (and yes, I used Grammarly to make sure I don't sound like a caveman).

## What is this blog site for
Big D and Small N is a site where Mr.D and I can document interesting discoveries and projects that we are currently working on. 

## What you can learn
Don't know! Just have a read through our ever-expanding catalogue until you find something mildly interiguing.

## Conclusion
Thnx for the read. It was a really short article. So here is a picture of a cat.
